# Assignment: The Secret Password

You are stuck in a virtual room and can only leave if you figure out the password! Fortunately, somebody left behind 6 clues for you to find the secret password, but the messaging is not that clear. It is your job to discover what the secret password is!

1. The very odd and inedible ingredient in a cake recipe
2. The season number that contains only 18 episodes (Hint: How do you list them?)
3. Fifth word of Season 6, Episode 21 of Friends
4. Fifth word of the fifth fictional Space Wars series
5. Second word of this song that's exactly 4 minutes long in this "colour" album
6. The fourth word to the fourth Hunger Games movie

## Instructions
1. Fork this Shell learning module repository following these [instructions](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/blob/main/onboarding_documents/submissions.md#setting-up)
2. Use your bash skills (such as `cd`, `cat`, etc.) to figure out what the secret password is! You will be exploring the `clues` directory in your bash terminal.
3. Write the secret password in your own version of this markdown file in your forked repo.

**What is the secret password?**
